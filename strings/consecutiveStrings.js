/*
You are given an array of strings called arr and an integer k. Your task is to return the longest string consisting of k consecutive strings from the array.

i.e. Which "k" consecutive strings in the array are the longest?

For example, if "k" is 2, and the array of strings is:
["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas"]

...then the longest two strings are "abigailtheta"

longestConsecutive(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas"], 2) // <--- "abigailtheta" 

To build your algorithm, consider "n"  the length of the array of strings. If n = 0, or k > n, or k <= 0, then return "" (an empty string).
